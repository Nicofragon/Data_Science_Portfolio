# Welcome to my Portfolio

Hi! Im Nicolas,
I'm Highly analytical and process-oriented data analyst with proficient knowledge of curation, manipulation and data visualization, supporting Marketing teams to drive ‘data-driven’ successful business solutions
I consider myself to be largely self- taught. Iʼm full of curiosity and passionate about entrepreneurship and the digital environment.
On a more personal note, I love to travel and meet new people and cultures. I have worked and lived in many countries over the years with global teams.
